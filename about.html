    <hr> <p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;"> NSU Bookshop aims to serve bibliophile students who seek an easy means of purchasing books based on their interests. Since books are regarded as essential components of contemporary civilization, it is only a matter of time before the century-old concept of libraries is digitalized.
    Students will be able to conduct B-commerce activities in the NSU Bookshop and create their own accounts to purchase/rent or even request books that aren't presently available in the library's index. NSU Bookshop is an example of Development Minilamism because it was built with the internet's most popular web-building tools and languages.
    The NSU Bookshop was founded by students who prioritized the inner circle and their book needs. With everything taken into account, this Bookshop website is unique in many ways, as we've added some features that are typically missing from mainstream Book-commerce sites. </h4></p>
